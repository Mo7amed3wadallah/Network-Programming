• What is I/O redirection in java? Give a code example.
>>
The Java System class allows you to redirect the standard input, output, and error I/O streams using simple static method calls:
-setIn(InputStream)
-setOut(PrintStream)
-setErr(PrintStream)

Redirecting output is especially useful if you suddenly start creating a large amount of output on your screen, and it’s scrolling past faster than you can read it.
Redirecting input is valuable for a command-line program in which you want to test a particular user-input sequence repeatedly. 

Example in file>> Redirection.java.

• What is Serialization in java? Give a code example.
>>
Serialization is the process of serializing the state of an object to be represented and stored in the form of a sequence of bytes.
This can be stored in a file. 
The process to read the state of the object from the file and restoring it is called deserialization.

Example in file>> Serialization.java.

• Compare between serial access and random-access files in terms of their 
>>
-- serial access files: Serial files are stored in chronological order, that is as each record is received it is stored in the next available storage position.

Advantages:
• Simple to handle
• The space on the storage medium can be utilized to the maximum possible extent.
• Widely used in small-scale applications

Disadvantages:
• We can't go directly to a specific record.
• It is not possible to add or modify records within an existing file.

--  random-access files: is a term used to describe a file or set of files that are accessed directly instead of requiring that other files be read first. 
Computer hard drives access files directly, where tape drives commonly access files sequentially

Advantages:
• Immediate access to record is possible.
• Up-to-date information will always be available on the file.
• Addition & deletion of record is not very complex.

Disadvantages:
• Records in a particular file must be of the Same length.
• Given string field must be of the same length for all records on the file.
• Numeric data is not in human-readable form

JFileChooser is a part of java Swing package. The java Swing package is part of JavaTM Foundation Classes(JFC) . 
JFC contains many features that help in building graphical user interface in java .
 Java Swing provides components such as buttons, panels, dialogs, etc . JFileChooser is a easy and an effective way to prompt the user to choose a file or a directory . 

1. JFileChooser() – empty constructor that points to user’s default directory
2. JFileChooser(String) – uses the given path 
3. JFileChooser(File) – uses the given File as the path 
4. JFileChooser(FileSystemView) – uses the given FileSystemView 
5. JFileChooser(String, FileSystemView) – uses the given path and the FileSystemView
6. JFileChooser(File, FileSystemView) – uses the given current directory and the FileSystemView 

Example in file>> FileChooser.java
